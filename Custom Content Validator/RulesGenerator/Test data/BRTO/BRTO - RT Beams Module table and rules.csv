[Attribute];Beam Sequence;DICOM tag (300A,00B0);R+*;an actor must be able to safely handle up to 100 beam sequence items (beams).;
[Attribute];>Beam Name;DICOM tag (300A,00C2);R+;the beam name must be unique within the sequence.;AttributeIsRequiredHasValueRule()
[Attribute];>Beam Type;DICOM tag (300A,00C4);R+*;in the brto profile, for geometric plans the value shall be static. only static beams shall be specified in geometric plans.  this will allow non-arc-based imrt (such as step-and-shoot or sliding window techniques, but not techniques such as fixed aperture arc beams, conformal arc beams, or intensity modulated arc beams. as a result, all beams in geometric plans shall consist of exactly two control points.;
[Attribute];>Radiation Type;DICOM tag (300A,00C6);R+*;any value other than photon is outside the scope of the profile;AttributeIsRequiredHasValueRule()
[Attribute];>High-Dose Technique Type;DICOM tag (300A,00C7);O+*;geometric plans shall not specify this attribute.;AttributeNotPresentRule()
[Attribute];>Treatment Machine Name;DICOM tag (300A,00B2);O+*;an actor must not rely on the presence of this attribute.;
[Attribute];>Source-Axis Distance;DICOM tag (300A,00B4);R+*;this attribute is critical for providing information regarding beam divergence.;AttributeIsRequiredHasValueRule()
;>Beam Limiting Device Sequence;(300A,00B6);;For the BRTO Profile, shall report at least one set of MLC descriptions or the descriptions of two sets of jaws.;

[Attribute];>>Block Data;DICOM tag (300A,0106);R+*;shall be present and non-null.  limitations on the total number of points are limited only by dicom limitations on representation with �explicit vr� in total byte lengths.  systems that limit support of legal sequences shall safely handle receipt of such sequences that exceed their limitations, and document this behavior in their ihe-ro profile adherence statement.;AttributeIsRequiredHasValueRule()
;>Applicator Sequence;(300A,0107);;Not expected in Geometric Plans.  However, if present, shall be handled in a safe manner by the receiving system (and document this behavior in their IHE-RO Profile adherence statement).
