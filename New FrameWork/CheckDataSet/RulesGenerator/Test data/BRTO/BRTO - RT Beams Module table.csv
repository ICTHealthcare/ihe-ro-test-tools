Attribute Name;Tag;Presence;Attribute Note
Beam Sequence;(300A,00B0);R+*;An actor must be able to safely handle up to 100 Beam Sequence Items (beams).
>Beam Name;(300A,00C2);R+;The Beam Name must be unique within the sequence.
>Beam Type;(300A,00C4);R+*;In the BRTO Profile, for Geometric Plans the value shall be STATIC. Only static beams shall be specified in Geometric Plans.  This will allow non-arc-based IMRT (such as Step-and-Shoot or Sliding Window techniques, but not techniques such as fixed aperture arc beams, conformal arc beams, or intensity modulated arc beams. As a result, all beams in Geometric Plans shall consist of exactly two control points.
>Radiation Type;(300A,00C6);R+*;Any value other than PHOTON is outside the scope of the profile
>High-Dose Technique Type;(300A,00C7);O+*;Geometric Plans shall not specify this attribute.
>Treatment Machine Name;(300A,00B2);O+*;An Actor must not rely on the presence of this attribute.
>Source-Axis Distance;(300A,00B4);R+*;This attribute is critical for providing information regarding beam divergence.
>Beam Limiting Device Sequence;(300A,00B6);;For the BRTO Profile, shall report at least one set of MLC descriptions or the descriptions of two sets of jaws.
>Referenced Patient Setup Number;(300C,006A);R+*;-
>Number of Wedges;(300A,00D0);R+*;Geometric Plans are constrained to a value of 0 (i.e. a Geometric Plan must not include a Wedge).
>Number of Compensators;(300A,00E0);R+*;Geometric Plans are constrained to a value of 0 (i.e. a Geometric Plan must not include a Compensator).
>Number of Boli;(300A,00ED);R+*;Geometric Plans are constrained to a value of 0 (i.e. a Geometric Plan must not include any Boli).
>Number of Blocks;(300A,00F0);R+*;All actors shall be able to handle 8 block items, of which no more than one may be an aperture
>Block Sequence;(300A,00F4);;-
>>Block Divergence;(300A,00FA);R+*;Must be present and non-null if Block Sequence is present (i.e. when Number of Blocks is 1 or more), with a value of PRESENT
>>Block Number of Points;(300A,0104);R+*;The value is constrained to be 3 or more.
>>Block Data;(300A,0106);R+*;Shall be present and non-null.  Limitations on the total number of points are limited only by DICOM limitations on representation with ‘explicit VR’ in total byte lengths.  Systems that limit support of legal sequences shall safely handle receipt of such sequences that exceed their limitations, and document this behavior in their IHE-RO Profile adherence statement.
>Applicator Sequence;(300A,0107);;Not expected in Geometric Plans.  However, if present, shall be handled in a safe manner by the receiving system (and document this behavior in their IHE-RO Profile adherence statement).  Applications exporting this sequence are outside the scope of the BRTO Profile.
>Final Cumulative Meterset Weight;(300A,010E);O+*;Shall not be present in a Geometric Plan.
>Number of Control Points;(300A,0110);R+*;Shall have a value of 2 for Geometric Plans.  
>Control Point Sequence;(300A,0111);R+*;In the BRTO Profile, for Geometric Plans the second control point (sequence item) shall contain only: • Control Point Index (300A,0112) with a value of 1 • Cumulative Meterset Weight (300A,0134) set to NULL. 
>>Cumulative Meterset Weight;(300A,0134);O+*;-
>>Referenced Dose Reference Sequence;(300C,0050);O+*;Shall not be present for Geometric Plans. Must not be relied upon by actors operating on the object as a Geometric Plan.
>>Nominal Beam Energy;(300A,0114);O+*;Actors must not rely on the presence of this attribute to operate correctly. However, if this attribute is present, actors may not ignore the value.
>>Dose Rate Set;(300A,0115);O+*;Actors must not rely on the presence of this attribute to operate correctly. However, if this attribute is present, actors may not ignore the value.
>>Wedge Position Sequence;(300A,0116);O+*;Must not be present in a Geometric Plan
>>Beam Limiting Device Position Sequence;(300A,011A);R+*;Must be present and correspond to those devices defined in the Beam Limiting Device Sequence. It shall be present for a Geometric Plan for Control Point Index 0 only.
>>Gantry Rotation Direction;(300A,011F);R+*;For a Geometric Plan for Control Point Index 0 only, must have a value of NONE.
