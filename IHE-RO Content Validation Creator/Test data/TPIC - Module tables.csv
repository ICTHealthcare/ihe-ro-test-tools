Bits Allocated;(0028,0100);R+*;Shall have Enumerated Value 16 if Value 3 of Image Type (0008,0008) is DRR.
Bits Stored;(0028,0101);R+*;Shall have Enumerated Value 16 if Value 3 of Image Type (0008,0008) is DRR.

Pixel Intensity Relationship Sign;(0028,1041);R+*;(See Issue 12)
RT Image Label;(3002,0002);R;User-defined label for RT Image.
RT Image Description;(3002,0004);O;User-defined description of RT Image.
Image Type;(0008,0008);R+*;The producer may produce any of the following types.¶The consumer must be able to consume all of the following types.¶Image identification characteristics (see Section C.7.6.1.1.2). RT Images shall use one of the following Defined Terms for Value:¶Digitally reconstructed radiographs = DERIVED\SECONDARY\DRR¶Simulator Images  = ORIGINAL\PRIMARY\SIMULATOR¶Portal Images = ORIGINAL\PRIMARY\PORTAL¶Radiographic Images = ORIGINAL\PRIMARY\RADIOGRAPH¶Fluence Images = DERIVED\SECONDARY\FLUENCE¶The Image Type shall solely characterize the type of the image as it was created. Any other use, e.g. to mark as digitally reconstructed RT Image (DRR) as PORTAL to specify an intended imaging procedure at the treatment session or alike is prohibited. That kind of information has to be conveyed either in imaging instructions as part of a DICOM Worklist interface, or in the Planned Verification Image Sequence (300A,00CA) where DICOM Worklist is not yet in place.¶Therefore the values ORIGINAL\PRIMARY\PORTAL and ORIGINAL\PRIMARY\RADIOGRAPH shall only be used for RT Images being Reference Images, if an image was effectively acquired at a treatment machine.
